        The Yemen Policy Center is an independent think tank established in 2020 by a group of Yemeni and German researchers associated with the Yemen Polling Center, a Yemeni NGO headquartered in Taiz, Yemen. Yemen Policy aims to impact local and international policymaking with the ultimate goal to improve the living conditions of the Yemeni people. With its research and advocacy activities, Yemen Policy works towards a closer integration of local perspectives into the policymaking process. While upholding the principles of the Human Rights Charter, Yemen Policyâ€™s strategy is to advocate for good governance reforms based on sound research and to support the creation of communication channels between citizens and state institutions. By seeking out and sharing positive stories and best practices, Yemen Policy not only aspires to put local communities into a position to help themselves but also to put Yemeni civil society activities into the spotlight.
